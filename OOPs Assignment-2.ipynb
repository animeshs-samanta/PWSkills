    "Changes to the implementation of a specific class do not affect the code that uses the class through a common interface.\n",

    "# 2. Describe the difference between composition and inheritance in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Composition and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that represent different ways of achieving code reuse and structuring classes. \n",
    "Here's a brief overview of the key differences between composition and inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "    Building Relationships:\n",
    "        Composition involves building relationships between classes by creating instances of one class within another. The containing class has components (instances of other classes)\n",
    "        as its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Has-A\" Relationship:\n",
    "        Composition is often described as a \"has-a\" relationship. For example, a Car class may \"have\" an Engine class and Wheel class as its components.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Encapsulation:\n",
    "        Composition promotes encapsulation by allowing objects to hide their internal details. The contained objects (components) are not exposed directly; instead, they are accessed \n",
    "        through well-defined interfaces provided by the containing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Flexibility:\n",
    "        Composition provides more flexibility because you can dynamically change the behavior of a class by altering its composed components. Components can be added, removed, or \n",
    "        replaced at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Establishing a Hierarchy:\n",
    "        Inheritance involves creating a hierarchy of classes where a subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of a superclass. The subclass is said to \"extend\" or \"derive from\"\n",
    "        the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Is-A\" Relationship:\n",
    "        Inheritance is often described as an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, a Dog class may inherit from an Animal class, indicating that a Dog is a specific type of Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Code Reuse:\n",
    "        Inheritance facilitates code reuse by allowing a subclass to inherit the attributes and methods of a superclass. This promotes a more hierarchical and structured codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Method Overriding:\n",
    "        Subclasses can override or extend the methods of the superclass, providing a way to customize or specialize behavior. This supports the concept of polymorphism.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simple Composition:\n",
    "    In simple composition, an object is composed of one or more other objects.\n",
    "    The composed object has a \"has-a\" relationship with its parts. For example, a Car class may have instances of Engine, Wheel, and Chassis as its components.\n",
    "    The lifecycle of the parts is tied to the lifecycle of the whole. If the Car is destroyed, its components are usually destroyed as well.\n",
    "    Simple composition implies a strong relationship between the whole and its parts, and typically, the parts are considered integral to the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Aggregation:\n",
    "    Aggregation is a specific form of association, representing a relationship where one class is a part of another class but can exist independently.\n",
    "    In aggregation, the \"has-a\" relationship still exists, but the parts can exist independently of the whole. For instance, consider a University class that has a collection of\n",
    "    Department objects. A Department can exist even if the University is not present.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The lifecycle of aggregated objects is not necessarily tied to the lifecycle of the whole. Destroying the University does not necessarily mean destroying all its Department objects.\n",

    "Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes:\n",
